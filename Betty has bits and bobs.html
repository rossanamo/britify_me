  <h1>Becky has lots of bits and bobs</h1>
  <p>"Confetti!", she cried. Her mouth opened in a grin, colourful pieces falling down, all over the floor, on the cupboard, on the bookshelf, near my feet. I was still hiding inside the utility room, shaking, deeply hoping that she would finally stop this madness. The only person left there, lost in my helplessness, swallowing my own breath to avoid even the most silent sound from my nose and mouth.</p>
  <p>She was whirling in the room, she was laughing. Her voice echoing in an almost empty space. Bits and bobs, remnants of what had once been, memories of a fortunate life, and she was dancing, lifting them in the air with rapid movements of her strong legs, caressing them with the palms of one hand, and all I could see was her long, sharp nails.</p>
  <p>Then, she stopped.</p>
  <p>Looked around her. As if she could feel the presence of another human body in the house. Her right eye blinked. Blinked. Blinked nervously, and her head twitched. Her flame red hair fluttered in the thick atmosphere. I was paralysed. She didn't make a motion, I kept still. Frozen. Her right eye blinking, her left one staring, as carved in stone.
  "Confetti!", she cried again, and squatted down, stroked the cold floor as to collect all possible objects and paper bites in one place, around her, safe.</p>
  <p>That didn't reassure me. That didn't reassure me at all. Her eyelids were still moving quickly. 
  Petrified.</p>
  <p>Then she turned her head and looked in my direction. She could not see me, I was well hidden, but I could feel her steel glance pierce the thin wall, perforate my flesh and my belly. Then she screamed "Confetti!" and lifted her heavy body and left the room. Entered the exit of the room. Towards the main door. Towards the garden. Towards the city. Towards my safety, my cold sweat along the length of my back and forehead and arms. My lungs painfully stretching out and aiming at some fresh air, my muscles so tense I could barely move them. My bones cracking.</p>
  <p>Becky had left the place, leaving behind her lots of bits and bobs and I slowly opened the door. Crawled on the floor, in case she could still be out there. It was only then I realised that it was not just some junk. There it was: paper marked with a trembling calligraphy, and train tickets. There were faded receipts, and cheap postcards from sunny resorts in the middle of the ocean. Kinder surprises, and foreign coins. A tacky pink lipstick from her first girlfriend and a key ring with a tiny, distorted rooster. A hair bobble and a lock of hair. Weird shapes, inexplicable textures. Mysterious smells. Creeps so intense. My intuition yelled at me to run, but it was only the memory (was that a memory, or was she still somewhere near?) of her distorted voice screaming "Confetti!" that made me finally lift my whole body and escape the place.</p>
  <p>It took years before I could access a level of awareness of those events clear enough for me to understand what I had witnessed.</p>
  <p>Now, son, would you and your friends please be so kind and quit eating mushrooms, for God's sake?</p>
