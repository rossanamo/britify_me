  <h1>Perfect Penelope</h1>
  <p>Penelope is the friend that carries an aspirin in her bag when you've been drinking too much. She's the one helping you out with your tax declaration and her hair won't need any styling when she gets out of the bed. She'd be planning to drive to Ikea just as you need to buy some furniture and is going to make a perfect dish out of the weirdest ingredients left in your fridge. Penelope is the kind of person you'll always take along with you, no matter what for a party you've been invited to, because she'll going to make you and your friends feel comfortable and self-confident. Penelope is the person you secretly wish you could be: smart, beautiful, humble and creative. But you won't hate her, you won't wish her anything bad ever to happen, because she's a good person and you are too, a good person. Although not as perfect as she is.</p>
  <p>That said, no one would ever want to tell (or hear) about how perfect someone else is, unless something's gone wrong. Here we are: the writer, the reader.</p>
  <p>One day, Penelope received a call from her grandmother. They've never grown fond of each other, if truth has to be said; something just doesn't work between them, and they meet only during family gatherings. Her grandma's call came for this reason totally out of the blue and Penelope tapped the phone icon without fully realising the consequences of her acts. The somehow grumpy old lady wanted to hear from her, be assured that everything was right and was wondering if, maybe, Penelope could possibly help her assemble a bunch of new furniture pieces (two bookshelves, a cute coffee table and a cupboard), as she recalled her nephew being quite handy. "Sure, grandma!", Penelope said in a rather low voice. She picked up the keys of her car, some tools she judged as useful for her purpose and drove to the countryside, into a light drizzle.</p>
  <p>Once arrived, she was welcomed with tea and ginger snaps, by far her favourite cookies. She could sense something was wrong, as her grandmother added a first splash of whisky in their cups. They had a natter and started to discuss about what had to be done in the afternoon. They had a good laugh, and a further sip of whisky in their throats. Penelope got finally up from her armchair and, tools in hand, started to study the instructions. The small screws go there, apply some pressure, measure carefully the distance between all parts; her grandmother was in the meantime washing the dishes from lunch and singing to herself. Penelope was not sure, though, whether that screw was really the one in her hand. And was the shelf to be turned upside down? As I told you before, she's perfectly human and, at that point, the feeling of not being able to handle the situation properly started to rise inside her mind and body. I am still wondering what for a powerful whisky she drank that day, was it homemade, perhaps?</p>
  <p>The pig from grandma's courtyard states that Ada, Penelope's grandmother, secretly smiled as she stepped in the room and saw her nephew, cross-legged, messing about with the instructions. "Sweetie, I've brewed you some fresh tea, have a cup more! Here it is, won't you take a break, my dear?" Penelope felt as she had been caught red-handed, nervously nodded and gulped down at once the whole spiced tea. She immediately started to cough and realised how hot, and heavily corrected, that tea was. Ada went out of the room gladly whistling and recalled that some work in the garden was waiting for her. While Ada was planting tomatoes, Penelope was making a pig's ear of assembling those bookshelves - Picasso's cubist art could not have been any better. In hindsight, Ada's deepest wish must have been to disinherit her nephew by proving how unhelpful, useless, unworthy even Penelope is - what she could not foresee, though, was how the situation would suddenly spin out of control.</p>
  <p>The pig would later also testify to Ada's horrified look as she realised how Penelope lighted a cigarette, how she violently sneezed, how she dropped the cigarette, how the cigarette gracefully whirled in the air and found its way into the teapot, accidentally left without lid, how the tea (or, should we say, the corrected whisky?) quickly caught fire, how Penelope panicked, jumped up and accidentally hit the teapot, how the burning liquids flew in the air, and, finally, how the whole cubist work started to burn. Penelope run, screaming, out of the house, and so did the pig. No one was able, for this reason, to testify to Ada's last words, but this little is certain: Penelope never inherited a thing from that branch of the family.</p>
