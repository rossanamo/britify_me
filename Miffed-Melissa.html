    <h1>Miffed Melissa</h1>
  <p>I know, she's such a lovely lady, isn't she! But that day? That day, I'll tell you, she was un-bea-ra-ble! I wish I could have met her when you two met, when her fury had vanished already. You got lucky that day, you nice boy! By then she was still a bit miffed, but that was it.
  What happened? 
  Right, well...</p>
  <p>If we were to trust her, the mouse is at fault for her waking up late, that morning. Ha-ha, so she's been using this excuse with you already? Well, what she said to me is, the mouse ate up her alarm clock and then ran away - had the mouse stayed in the same room, she moaned, at least she would have heard the alarm, through its belly. The animal, instead, - how insolent of it! - did not make her such a favour and went away, minding its own business. Puking up that rusted alarm clock, for sure. The result is that she didn't wake up at all, and when she finally got out of bed, the stagecoach had gone. Last departure for the morning. Bear in mind: the day before she had some pints with friends, and by "some" I am being sarcastic now. However.
  </p>
  <p>Now she's a sorceress, she could have just jumped on the broom and in 5 minutes she would have arrived at work as if nothing had happened. But no, nonsense! Don't you dare suggesting such a heresy! She says that it's not convenient, and that the wind messes up her hair, and each and every time she'll gonna find a new excuse for you. I sense she'll still having trouble with her identity, she just cannot cope with her own nature. A classic. Sure, it's not like every cashier at Tesco spends her spare time preparing potions and whatever other weird elixirs she may cook, but if she really doesn't want to stick out she could start by wearing soberer clothes, am I right?
  </p>
  <p>Anyway, she decided that hitchhiking would be a smart idea and started to walk along the main road, gesticulating to cars passing by. She had to walk a long way, I'll tell you, before someone finally halted and picked her up. By then she was already almost arrived, she says. The driver was a nice old lady, but not only had she a nice flowered blue dress, she was also a bit deaf. Yes, you've guessed right: she drove her to the wrong Tesco. Poor her, I was in front of the shop when I saw Melissa rushing out of the car, yelling at her, and you should have seen, such a sorry face the old lady had! I guess there is one person less around, willing to help people on the road.
  </p>
  <p>From now on, what I'll tell you is pure facts - because I've seen it with these very eyes, my friend. You've got to believe in my words!
  </p>
  <p>Melissa almost bumped into me, and me, I was just peacefully smoking my first joint of the day and the way she moved, unconcerned, what could I do? Her hair caught fire in a second and she started to scream, and hit my joint, what the hell, you know? I was pissed off too, by then! But to be honest, the scene was so hilarious I was about to burst out laughing in her very face. No, no, I didn't. I threw what I had left of my beer all on her hair, and, abracadabra! I extinguished the fire and her hair was the same as before. You don't believe in me? Look at her now! Do you see traces of fire? I don't.
  </p>
  <p>I'm almost done. I did feel a bit sorry for her, to tell you the truth (although I had just lost both joint and beer), so I decided to drive her to work and in no time we were in Tesco's parking lot. As soon as we got out of the car, though, it started raining cats and dogs and in a second we were dripping water as if we had fallen down into the river - soaked wet to the freaking bones, dammit! Now I got angry, because, you remember those shoes of mine? They were new and they were nice and white and tight and now they're, like, boats! I should just drop them in the first waste basket I see, useless, dammit! Such a bad quality, and I'll tell you, I did spend some money on it! Right, calming down.
  </p>
  <p>Melissa stared at me yelling, dripping cold water in the middle of the parking lot, and you could see it in her eyes, she wanted to laugh so bad, the sorceress! If it weren't for that sudden gust of wind, that almost knocked her off her feet, and slam!, for the bat that slammed against her hat and whirled away confused. Hahaha! Such a scene! Yeah, that's when you arrived, and picked up her hat from the ground.</p>
  <p>True story, my friend, true story. Now, I apologise, I really have to go. Take care of yourself, man!</p>
