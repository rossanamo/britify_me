  <h1>The drowsy story of knackered Nick</h1>
  <p>"Nick, my dear, where are you? Breakfast is served!" screamed the old lady, with the "a" of "breakfAst" slightly trembling in her wrinkled throat. Nick didn't answer. In fact, he didn't hear. He was too busy sleeping, wrapped up in his sheets, buried under a continental quilt that had gloriously survived the '70, had almost vanished in a fire during the late '80 and was now there, badly covering Nick's body, a sad decoration and a safe keeper of his bodily warmth.</p>
  <p>Nick's body was intent on slowly and rythmically lifting up this whole defence toward the outer world, with a sound that recalled scratching squirrels but was nothing else than the expression of obstructed, large nostrils. Nick was sleeping, and nothing could have ever woken him up after that night, he thought.</p>
  <p>"Nick, my dear, wanking is evil."</p>
  <p>Said his old grandma before smashing her rolling pin on his uncombed head. Not sure whether she was aware of what she pointed at, when she lifted such a weapon in the air, but as a result Nick instantly jumped from that useless mountain of blankets and sprouted blood from his nose, brutally staining the front of grandma's simple dress. Another rolling pin-attack fell down on him and this turned out to be the moment he understood he was awake, back in the wild world.
  Back to life.
  Back to business.
  Back to his reality, the one he had wanted so badly to erase the night before.</p>
  <p>It had started oh so well, knackered by some quick but healthy sex that had made all necessary endorphins circulating in his body and helped him reaching happiness. By then he was not very communicative. It was, back then, quite an adjectiveless night.</p>
  <p>Oh, my poor Nick, you may say of yourself.</p>
  <p>As said, it was almost a silent night. No need for descriptions. What could one say, that hadn't already been put into words and repeated, narration after narration? The lights of the city fading inside the thick fog, the traffic slowly obstructing the street, some stubborn cyclists swinging through a forest of streetlamps, the first swollen zombies emerging from the city's crowded pubs. Nothing new, no awakening illustrations worth to be heard.</p>
  <p>Nick was standing there with a cigarette. Nick swallowed another sip of rum from the bottle. Nick walked toward the bridge, absent-mindedly greeted his long-time schoolmate, got past the vending machine revealing glamorous packets of cigarettes and condoms, took another sip. Such a flat night like this turns easily into an absence of memories, as soon as you go over the line. Isn't it so, Nick? Colours and odours tend to melt, and all of a sudden you find adjectives as the main ornament to all descriptions. All of a sudden, you cannot remember but you live every detail as pressed down and impressed with fire, and you need descriptions to recount all circumstances to your feeble mind.</p>
  <p>You are one of those zombies, Nick, can you see that? You could run into a dinosaur spitting fire - that would be the shivering hot red air, and the sinister squeaking sound of minor objects squeezed under its scaled paws.
  Nick, you could find yourself in a car accident - you would only hear the breaking of your bones, and the car sheet sparkling against the asphalt.
  Nick, did you see all of this, or did you just dream it under those blankets? Why were you putting such an effort in embroidering the appearance of reality? A cigarette, Nick, at that point, wasn't any longer a cigarette - rather a white nightly piercing fading into smoke. What did you smoke that night, Nick? Wandering in the first soft lights of a new day, sleepless, bags under the eyes, knackered from the intensity of your experiences, Nick, you were the zombie in a pink t-shirt.</p>
  <p>Nick, do you hear yourself moaning crushed on the sofa?</p>
